 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

                             Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share the software and to ensure that it is free for all
its users.  This General Public License applies to the software
package that you have received with this license.  If you do not
receive a copy of this license, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  For the purpose of this license, "the Program" refers to any
copyrighted work licensed under this License. Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is not restricted, as long as the output is not a
modified version of the Program.

  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
equivalent rights, and does not restrict them.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  "You" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising
permission granted by this License. "Your" is interpreted
accordingly.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
non-source form of a work.

  "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
the absence of an official standard, is widely used among
developers working in the same field.

  "The System" means the combination of the Program and the
associated interface, if any, through which the Program is
interfaced with the user.

  "User " means any person who uses the Program.

  "Modification" means any change to the Program or to any
part of it, including but not limited to changes in the source
code, changes in the object code, and changes in the
documentation.

  "Distribution" means any form of making the Program available
to others, including but not limited to selling, giving away,
or making available for download.

  "Conveying" means any form of distribution of the Program,
including but not limited to selling, giving away, or making
available for download.

  "Propagating" means conveying the Program in a way that
allows others to use it.

  "You" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising
permission granted by this License. "Your" is interpreted
accordingly.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive commands, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these terms.

  3. You may also convey non-source forms of the Program, such as compiled object code, provided that you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this License.

    b) Keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  5. If you convey a covered work, you must collect and provide the same rights to the recipients of the work. You must also provide a copy of this License to each recipient.

  6. If you modify a covered work and convey it, you must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed the work and the date of the change.

  7. You may not use the name of the Free Software Foundation or the names of its contributors without written permission.

  8. This License shall not be construed as granting any rights to use the Program in a manner that would infringe any patent or copyright.

  9. If you are a corporation, you must ensure that your employees and agents comply with the terms of this License.

  10. This License is intended to be a legal document and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is enforced.

  11. If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

  12. The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. It is designed to ensure that software remains free for all users.
